# START HERE

This repo is a **support system** for the Official Gaggiuino Documentation.
It does not contain rewritten install steps.

If anything conflicts, the Official Docs win.

## The One Rule You Don’t Break

Installation procedures must be followed directly from the
**Official Gaggiuino Documentation (ZIP)**.

This repo may route you, clarify safety, define prerequisites, and define rollback points.
It may **not** summarize or rewrite the official steps.

---

## Quick Routing

### “I don’t know where to start.”
Go to the official docs entrypoint:
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/_sidebar.md`

(These are inside the official docs content.)

Also see:
- `docs/00_suitcase/zip_map.md`

### Wiring / Electrical Questions
1. Confirm your install route in:
   - `docs/01_build/build_profile.md`
2. Use the official install path in:
   - `docs/guides-stm32/`
3. Cross-check visuals in:
   - `docs/schematics/`
   - `docs/media/`

Repo support location:
- `docs/03_procedures/` (support-only routing/risk/prereqs)
