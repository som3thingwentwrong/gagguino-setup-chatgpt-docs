# Procedures

This folder does NOT contain installation instructions.

All installation steps must be followed directly from
the Official Gaggiuino Documentation.

This folder exists to:

- Route to the correct official documentation section
- Define risk level
- Define live-power requirements
- Define prerequisites
- Define rollback points
- Provide safety framing

It must never duplicate or summarize official install steps.

Use:
docs/_templates/procedure_template.md

Each support file must include:

- Official source path
- Risk level
- Live power requirement
- Reversibility
- Rollback point
- Prerequisites
