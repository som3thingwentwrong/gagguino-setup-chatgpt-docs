# Build Context

This folder defines the locked configuration and safety boundaries.

- build_profile.md → machine identity + scope + definition of done
- safety_rules.md → non-negotiable safety requirements
- beau_reference.md → mascot behavior + safety escalation tone

These documents govern HOW we work, not WHAT we install.
